## Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

1.  **Description of the dataset**: The instacart dataset contains
    1384617 observations and 15 variables. The varibales are order_id,
    product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set,
    order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order,
    product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department. The
    dataset inclueds 39123 different products, which belongs to 134
    aisles in 21 departments. The dataset records how products get added
    into different shopping carts by different users and the products’
    information as well. For example, Bulgarian Yogurt was added to the
    order 1 by customer whose user id is 112108 at 10 o’clock, which is
    the 1st product added to the cart.

2.  **How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?**

There are 134 aisles. The top 3 aisles that are frequently ordered from
are stated below:

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(3) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      |      n |
|:---------------------------|-------:|
| fresh vegetables           | 150609 |
| fresh fruits               | 150473 |
| packaged vegetables fruits |  78493 |

3.  **Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.**

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  mutate(aisle = factor(aisle, levels = aisle)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = aisle, yend = 1), width = 15) +
  geom_point(size = 4, color = "pink") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("")
```
